## Project Description:

Insurance app is a simple Dapp based on the ethereum blockchain. It can be used as an alternative to the existing approach. Here the insurance policy holder registers himself by providing necessary proofs. Only a registrar or government authority or company who is registered as the super admin can do the modifications to the system like adding new miners. The smart contract has been written in such a way that when user claims for insurance it will be analyzed by the authorized personnel or miner who are approved by the company or government, when the number of miners who verify a claim in greater than 50% than insurance claim is approved and the user is provided with the insurance money. Even though the registration process requires a government authority, the entire process is transparent and the transaction happens between the two clients without any intermediaries.
